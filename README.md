## 📈 Learning Philosophy
> “I don’t wait to be ready. I build first, then refine. Every dashboard teaches me something new — about data, business, and myself.”

This portfolio is not just a collection of files — it’s a **learning journal in action**, showing progression from basic charts to integrated, multi-tab, cross-functional reports.
